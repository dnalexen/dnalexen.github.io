## Alexandre Djossou Portfolio

This is an overview of my data science projects. I have a big interest in Artificial Intelligence and its applications in Business Intelligence, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and IoT.

My experiences include an understanding of classic Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. I have developed Sales Forecasting, Customers Churn Prediction, Anomalies Detection models and Computer Vision application with Python and its well known libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch, Sklearn, TensorFlow.

Hereafter, my projects.

### Data Science projects

#### 1- Customer Churn Prediction
Brief explanation of the project and the algorithm used - add link nbviewer(https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and github

#### 2- Link prediction
Brief explanation of the project and the algorithm used - add link nbviewer(https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and github

#### 3- AI for Water Meter Reading
The objective of this project is to design an algorithm to read the exact consumption index from a valid picture of a meter.
We used an implementation of the YOLOv4 algorithm that we customed to our [dataset](https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/30/).
The model is live on a [web app](https://ai-water-meter-reading.herokuapp.com/).
You can have a look on the code on the [project's Github Repository](https://github.com/dnalexen/ai_water_meter_reading). 

#### 4- Defect Prediction on Production Lines
Brief explanation of the project and the algorithm used - add link nbviewer(https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and github

#### 5- News analysis
Brief explanation of the project and the algorithm used - add link nbviewer(https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and github

#### 6- Real Estate Price Prediction
