## Alexandre Djossou Portfolio

This is an overview of my data science projects. I have a big interest in Artificial Intelligence and its applications in Business Intelligence, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and IoT.

My experiences include an understanding of classic Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. I have developed Sales Forecasting, Customers Churn Prediction, Anomalies Detection models and Computer Vision application with Python and its well known libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch, Sklearn, TensorFlow.

Hereafter, my projects.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dnalexen/dnalexen.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
